############### Injector Parameters ##################
#
#    hdf5_file - the path to the hdf5 file to corrupt
#    prob - probability to inject corruption
#    corruption_percentage - value between 0-100, it represents the percentage of entries to corrupt (based on the HDF5 amount of entries)
#    byte - which byte is faulty (0-7) -1 random
#    use_random_locations - choose random locations on the file to inject errors, if true it will ignore the locations_to_corrupt
#    locations_to_corrupt - list of locations to try to inject errors
# do we need a probability of injection? here we definitely want to inject errors
